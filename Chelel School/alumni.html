        <p>Turi Alumni are part of the international Chelel family. This area of our website allows Old Chelelians to connect with old friends, find out latest news and upcoming reunions. We are very grateful for the ongoing support and contribution of the Old Chelelians.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>All Chelelian students become members of the Old Chelelian Association the minute they depart for pastures new. This means they are welcome back at Chelel, at the Old Chelelian events, and can receive regular timely updates on what’s going on at the School. At present, the Old Chelelian database is being updated, and some of the details we hold might be out of date. Please help us keep it accurate by letting us know if you change your contact details.</p>
