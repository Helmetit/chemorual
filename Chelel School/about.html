    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Our Unique Environment</h2>
        <p>Chelel Memorial School is totally unique in terms of the beauty and space available. The 5 acres is made up of school buildings, boarding houses & gardens, state-of-the-art sports and arts facilities, sports pitches, a riding school and paddocks, forest areas, nature trails, and a low ropes course.</p>
        <p>Wildlife is encouraged at the school, and we have the privilege of hosting a variety of native species within our grounds, including birds, small mammals, and butterflies that add to the natural beauty of the environment. The school takes pride in its commitment to sustainability and environmental education, with students actively participating in conservation projects and wildlife monitoring. Our nature trails and forest areas serve as outdoor classrooms where students can learn about ecology, biodiversity, and the importance of preserving natural habitats. The serene and picturesque surroundings provide an inspiring setting for both academic and extracurricular activities, fostering a deep connection to nature and a sense of responsibility towards the environment.</p>
        <p>As a Round Square School, we are committed to protecting and enhancing the beautiful environment around us. We have a number of student-led environmental groups who work with the Estate Team to manage and address environmental issues. In the past, they have focused on recycling, education on biodiversity, sustainable sources of energy, and indigenous forests.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Chelel Memorial School was founded by Mr. Vincent in 2020. With an initial enrolment of 15 children, 'Chelel' has grown into one of the leading international schools in the region, catering to over 200 students.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vincent used his skills to successfully set up and run the school. He feels his work is in direct obedience to God’s calling to build a Christian school, hence the strong emphasis on Christian love and care in the running of the school to date. In 2021, the Senior School was added to provide a caring, safe, and friendly boarding environment for students aged 14 to 18.</p>

        <h2>Developing Leaders</h2>
        <p>Chelel Memorial School believes that in order for our students to thrive in whatever sphere of life they choose, they need not only qualifications but also the faith, character, and personal skills to make a difference.</p>
        <p>Developing leaders starts from a young age. At the Prep School, the Leader in Me program is incorporated into the everyday life of pupils, with an emphasis on service. They regularly visit schools and charities to assist those less fortunate than they are.</p>
        <p>At the Senior School, leadership skills are honed through involvement in the Round Square program, which emphasizes key values and provides practical opportunities.</p>
        <p>At the Sixth Form College, students go through a structured two-year leadership program (Chelel Memorial School Leadership Award) which teaches professional leadership skills and culminates in a university-accredited qualification. It is designed to build and mold the next generation of leaders who have integrity and a vision for Africa.</p>
